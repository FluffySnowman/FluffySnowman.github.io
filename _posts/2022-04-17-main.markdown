# Networking Basics

Networking is a simple yet complex part of the computing experience. It is essentially the connection between computers (phones and tablets included) and servers. The communication between these computers and servers is done through a network. Transmission of data (in packets) is done through a network.

A network consists of many things. First thing is an IP (Internet Protocol) Address that is an address that tells the router on the network which computer is which. Learn how to change your IP Address [here](#change-your-ip). Sometimes people set up routers and firewalls to bind IP Addresses and MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. A MAC address is the address/hexadecimal code that identifies the ID of your NIC (Network Interface Card). Most people don't change MAC IDs or don't know how to. You can learn how to do this [here](#change-your-mac-address).

The Default configuration for routers' gateways are `192.168.1.1`. A gateway is the network node through all traffic travels through to the WWW (World Wide Network) or another IP/MAC on your network. You can change the settings in the network to send data from IP to IP instead of routing it through the gateway too but that is a bit complicated and we will leave it for later.

#### Netmasks

Each router has a certain amount of devices(IPs) that can connect to it. This is determined by the 1/24 or 0/24 added at the end of the gateway IP also known as netmask. IP calculators are the easier way of determining how many devices are allowed.
For Example: A network with netmask of `/24` will allow up to 254 devices at a time however a network with netmask of `/23` will allow 510 devices at a time.

#### DHCP

IP addresses can be changed very easily. There are certain protocols used for machines to automatically determine their IP addresses. One of these is known as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). This protocol basically queries the IPs on the router and automatically chooses an IP (which has not been taken by any other machine (free ip)) for the machine when it connects to the network and assigns it to the machine.
However, this protocol can be very problematic. Sometimes there is a problem where the router is queried by two different machines and the same IP is given to two different machines. This is called an "IP Conflict" and can be resolved by changing the IP address of the machine (setting the IP in settings to manual and changing it).

#### DNS

Then we have the DNS, also known as Domain - Name - System. The DNS is basically a mediatory node which sends traffic from the router to the rest of the internet. It is used to name and identify services, computers and other resources on the internet. Changing your DNS can reduce load times on your website. Learn how to change your DNS [here](#change-your-dns).

### Change your ip

To change your (LOCAL) IP address on windows;
Start>Control Panel>Network and sharing centre>(left panel)>Change Adapter Settings.
Once you have clicked the endpoint, simple select the adapter you want to change and right click>properties.

You will be greeted with this window:

Click on the blue/selected field shown in the image and click properties.

</p>

After you reach the properties page, Select the "Use the following IP address" option and enter the IP address you want to use.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/pics/change_ip_0x2.png" alt="change_ip_0x2">
</p>

Fill in the field according to your network configuration. To find out your network configuration, hit "control+r" to open the run window and type in `cmd` and hit enter.

<p align="center">

</p>

Once you are in the terminal window, simply type in `ipconfig` and look for something that looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/pics/change_ip_0x4.png" alt="change_ip_0x4">
</p>

Fill in the respective fields in the respective boxes in your "Internet Protocol Version 4" window.
Once you have closed and saved the control panel windows, the IP should have changed.
Re-open the command prompt (cmd) window and type in the same command (`ipconfig`) to see your new IP and voila!
