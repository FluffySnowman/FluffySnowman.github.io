DISCLAIMER: THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE THESE TECHNIQUES IN ANY MALICIOUS WAY.

So to get started you must have a security version of linux such as [parrot][parrot os link] os or kali linux and then install "aircrack-ng".

Once you have this installed then you need a wireless card that can go into monitor mode. It is recommended that you should have an external wireless card that can handle multiple bands of wireless connections like 2.4GHZ or 5GHZ.

After you have all of that setup its time to start hacking (ethically of course)!.

Open up a temrinal and make sure you have superuser/root access. To do this simple type: 

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo su
{% endhighlight %}

Enter your password and continue.
